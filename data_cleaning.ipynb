Since you’ve had this brew before what’s it like this year? The ’19 version of Arabashiri is more controlled and smooth than in year’s past. It is smooth with round and rolling fruit tones that are juicy and soft, semi-thick, semi-rich and fully tasty. The larger the vessel the more zesty and fresh feeling with honeydew melon, pear, apple, and a hint of grapefruit.

There is a very interesting astringency that jumps between a subtle tartness and a refreshing sour quality that makes this sake drink very much like a big dry red wine.

It is so light, bright, and refreshing but is loaded with really tasty flavors such as white grape, honeydew melon, blueberry, and tons of minerals like snowball melt. There is also a very unique vein of citrus tones such as tangerine, and grapefruit, with an added powder sugar touch.

Not too heavy and not too light it is a semi-dry slippery slide that has Ginjo elegance and a very nice acidity balance. This brew has the best finish of all ten Fall Draft Hiyaoroshi this year.

This Hiyaoroshi’19 is different from last year’s offering because it uses an entirely different rice varietal called Aiyama milled to 75%. The result is a fruity and wonderful. Rich, round, and sweet it is full-fluid fresh. There are lots of plum, melon, date, apple, and purple fig flavors and maybe that’s why the label is purple. The brew does well in a mid-sized glass and it gets creamier as it warms in the glass. Very layered. Very lush. Very plump.

       "       'True Sake owner Beau Timken recorded Kikusui as the first entry in his personal journal of over 200 sakes and would later purchase Kikusui as his first case of sake, thus Kikusui holds a special place on our shelves. This Ginjo has a slightly fruity nose with hints of citrus and persimmons. Kikusui has a confidently smooth beginning with a gradual thickening viscosity that ends in a slightly salty aftertaste. Dry, sharp and smooth according to most, this Ginjo sits well in the mouth and will tease you with sweet fruit tones and a dry finish. Kikusui is fermented at a low temperature longer than most Ginjos to rid the sake of the sometimes \"heavy\" characteristics of a Junmai, thus giving it an overall light and dry complexion.

Yup – the nose has given this sake away as one of those “Mystery” sake that every sake fan at some point must try. Why a mystery?

It drinks more full because of the Nihonbare rice varietal and the elevated acidity, which speaks to tannin lovers who enjoy a little astringency complexity in their glass. Speaking to you red wine drinkers who enjoy subtle yet complex flavors such as persimmon, apricot, chicory, dark chocolate, and caramel licks. There is a tickle of bitterness in the finish that speaks to the craft coffee crew and far more ricey expressions come out as the fluid warms in the glass.

       "       'The nose on this specially released winter unpasteurized sake, has a gentle collection of green apple, peach, grape, and mineral aromas. Say hello to the first edition of KID “Shiboritate” that is new to the US market. This is a unique sake that is very elegant and easy in the palate. Fresh and light, it carries gentle flavors like green apple, kiwi, young strawberry, apricot, and fresh pear notes with a crisp flow. And let’s talk about the flavor of water in this Junmai Ginjo that is subtle, soft, and has a twinkle of minerals. For you professional sake drinkers, try to process the acidity level of 2.0 in this elegant brew. It’s a phantom acidity that plays like a whisper, and makes the sake balanced and elegant. Enjoy fresh sake at its freshest.',\n",
       "       'The nose on this sake, that is made with the local Iwate popular Gin Ginga rice varietal, is a gentle collection of plum, honeydew melon, sweet rice, pear, and honey aromas. The head sake brewer Ryunosuke Furudate of Akabu Shuzo has a simple philosophy for his sake, and that is to not think too much about the brews and simply just enjoy them. This sake, like their other offerings, is a great example of playing in the subtle zone of sake making. It’s so gentle and nuanced, that your first thought is that this is a simple sake, and that’s the key to the elegance and balance of this brew. It’s silky, light, fresh, and balanced, with a gentle water-like texture that makes this sake very easy to drink. Look for blueberry, grape, melon, pear, lychee, and snow-cone flavors, that excel in a medium-sized cup. As the fluid warms in the glass, a creaminess comes forth and lots of umami. This is phantom sake at its best, because it drinks like a whisper and just disappears.',\n",
       "       'For the first time available in the US, this Ultra Junmai Daiginjo sake is a work of art in liquid form. Using absolutely the best Yamadanishiki brewing rice from Hyogo Prefecture milled to the insanely low rate of 30%. This treasure is not to be missed! (Especially considering the brewery only produces a few hundred bottles per year) The nose on this elegant sake is a gentle collection of steamed rice, honey, bamboo, and white pepper. Finally! Finally a super premium sake that has some body and depth to it! This is no “like-water”, thin brew, but rather it is a smooth operator with great texture play. Look for hints of melon, ripe pear, honeycomb, and vanilla bean. Muryozan is so complex, but oh so drinkable, with a tremendously soft, smooth, plump, and velvety body. Served chilled in a white wine glass.',\n",
       "       'The nose on this cult favorite sake has corn, steamed rice, persimmon, peach, sweet carrots, and citrus aromas. The brewer of this sake purposely doesn’t give out technical specs, because he simply wants you to not geek out and “just drink the sake.” That’s pretty funny in an industry where we try to know everything, and sometimes forget to simply enjoy a brew. Light, silky, gentle, and clean, this sake is very mischievous, because it drinks very easily, but it has so much going on. “Drinkable” is not a bad word in the sake world, but it has a negative connotation in that it could mean it’s basic. This Junmai is anything but basic as it has whispers of phantom-like qualities, that drink so gently and balanced. Look for hints of grapefruit, blood orange, cucumber, sweet veggies, citrus, and blueberry flavors in a supremely silky fluid. A mid-sized glass finds peak balance, and there is a very unique creaminess that emerges as the sake warms. It’s also a great brew for warming, that drinks slightly fruity and clean.',\n",
       "       '*All sales are final with Juyondai. Must call the shop to order Juyondai. Limit 1 bottle per person. Even though inventory says \"sold out\", we might have it in stock. Just ask!True Sake was able to source 12 bottles of this Juyondai dated 2019.06 which has been bottle aging for 18 months. This is considered leaving its prime tasting form, but we as a group, all agreed that this sake still drinks very much like how the toji intended it to taste. By purchasing this sake you accept the conditions that it is as is! So what is it? The nose on this extremely sought after Junmai Ginjo is a gentle collection of berry, cantaloupe, pear, sweet rice, and apple aromas. Juyondai is known for impact on first sip, and this brew is exactly that – pure impact. It is lively, effervescent, bright, fleshy, and very fruit-forward. Look for a large flavor field of apple, cooked pear, ripe cantaloupe, mango, strawberry, honey, and a hint of fennel. Basically, this is world-class sake that everybody wants to taste and for good reason. A great example of a fruity and balanced sake that excels in a wine glass. If you have ever wanted to taste a brew from the fabled Juyondai brewery this might be your best shot, and we feel it’s worth that shot!'],\n",
