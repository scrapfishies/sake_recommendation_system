It is smooth with round and rolling fruit tones that are juicy and soft, semi-thick, semi-rich and fully tasty. The larger the vessel the more zesty and fresh feeling with honeydew melon, pear, apple, and a hint of grapefruit. A mid-sized glass brings out the best flavor to feeling play, but whatever you drink out of you will taste fresh sake at its best.

Round, smooth, and a little snappy this brew is loaded with some very interesting flavors such as raisin, crisp apple, black berries, and cooked persimmon. There is a very interesting astringency that jumps between a subtle tartness and a refreshing sour quality that makes this sake drink very much like a big dry red wine.

Gone are the fruit pops, but there is a gentle collection of fruit elements such as ripe pear, cooked grapes, fruit component with a hint of blueberry. Even and well balanced this brew has a new smoothness that does well in the mouth. Semi-fat, semi-dry and a lurking subtle rich sweetness only comes forth as the fluid warms and that is why the toji likes drinking it at room temp.

","48":"This is one of if not the most sought after Daiginjo in Japan. This Daiginjo is sophisticated and yet very drinkable, perhaps too drinkable as the phantom finish leaves you wondering if you swallowed or not. The nose is a clever balance of honeysuckle and tuberose. The first sip spells the strength in clarity of this sake. Subtle flavors of fuji apple and tart pear dance through the cleanest mouth in the sake world.

At 19.9% alcohol one would expect a massive punch of a sake, but this creamy and fruity brew is smooth a round for such a robust dance partner. Look for hints of berry, grape, and vanilla tones that are carried on a velvety and expansive fluid. Not overtly sweet and a tremendous finish for a 20% milky madman! Think milky and silky.

WORD: Velvety WINE: Large reds\/fat whites BEER:creamy Belgians FOODS: shellfish, sushi, creamy dishes, grilled fare.","51":"All four of these sakes are pretty similar, but each has unique qualities. The nose on Black is a clean rice and mineral mix. This is the least \u201cpremium\u201d of the cans, but it tastes cleaner and more compact \u2013 elegant \u2013 than the others. The balance is the first thing that hits the palate. It is not as huge and impactful as the Gold, Red, and Green cans, and it drinks even from first sip to the tail. There is a gentle sweetness but that plays second fiddle to the clean feeling and there is no kick. There are no mood swings with Black just a gentle nama \u201cunpasteurized\u201d drinking experience that is far more balanced than the other cans.

This popular Ginjo has unique spicy nose of apples and roasted nuts, and this aroma translates over into the taste profile. It is obviously well built, as the consistency is overwhelming from first sip to the non-existent ending. Classic Niigata style brewing means that Hakkaisan has a superbly clean mouth texture and a whisper finish and should be tasted at least once in every sake drinker\u2019s lifetime. WORD: Desirable WINE: Super clean sauvignon blancs BEER: Light beers FOODS: Sashimi, light meats, grilled fish.

It is a very special brew that is round, clean, with a nice nougat finish. It has more body than most cup sake, and it is incredibly smooth. There are hints of rice sweetness, but the overall drinking experience is dry. It feels really good in the mouth as the texture is round, rich, chewy and very easy.

Every once in a while it\u2019s fun to try a different type of sake and this is it. Basically this is a Tokubetsu Junmai sake with all-natural Yuzu (a Japanese citrus that is sort of lemony-orange) juice added to it. It is low in alcohol 7% and is considered to be sweet. The nose is obviously very citrusy and the first sip \u2013 after you smile \u2013 says that this is not a silly sake but a very flavorful drinking experience. There is an abundance of fat and chewy (but not goopy) citrus flavors that are balanced by a firm acidity all on a smooth and expansive flow. It is sweet, but not overtly so. This is not a cheap infused sake that you see out on the market with apple and lychee fake flavors, rather this a quality sake with quality Yuzu added for an amazingly bright and fun mouth party.

The nose on the Green is far more nama-like with floral and lemon grass aromas, which is appropriate because this can is a seasonal released sake that uses freshly harvested rice. This can has so much presence and drinks as impactful as the Gold can. Big, bright, boozy and fun this is a party in a can. It has layers of flavors from fruity to honey-like.

Den Sake\u2019s owner\/brewer Yoshihiro Sako has now delivered his 12th run of sake to the Bay Area and the world. Each step in the process has been a learning example for Yoshi using his local rice, water, and imported yeasts to create a balance and style unique to Den. It\u2019s safe to say that after all of the previous efforts, Den has achieved their thumbprint in the sake world. And Batch #12 represents this thumbprint well with a tantalizing acidity and gentle fruit flavors, with an overall richness that is great alone and fantastic to pair with cuisines of all types. Clean, light, bright, and a little zesty, this living Nama (unpasteurized) sake has hints of green apple, young pear, tangerine, lime, and a little touch of banana candy flavors that excel in a wine glass. The citrusy flavors are balanced with a richness that supports an overall umami sensation. Enjoy Yoshi\u2019s journey and enjoy Den. WORD: Lively WINE: Zesty Reds\/Crisp Whites BEER: Crisp Fruity Ales FOODS: Shellfish, grilled fare, salty and savory fare, citrus-based fare.","64":"This unique Ginjo uses a brewing rice called Ginfubuki and that may account for the nice richness and cocoa flavor that courses through the smooth fluid. The nose on this sake is a dusty collection of dried rice, cocoa, and balsa wood aromas. I always like saying a sake is rich and tastes like chocolate, and this is the case here. Smooth, rich, round, and full-bodied this is not your fruity or too clean Ginjo, rather it is a good expression of sake that has nougat, cream, and chocolate flavors galore.

The nose on the semi-cloudy Ginjo nigori that is milled to 50% is a light collection of creamcycle, star fruit, citrus, and cream aromas. Talk about a suave and very elegant slightly misty sake, this brew is a gateway sake to get nigori drinkers to gravitate to filtered sakes. It is very easy on the palate with layers of gentle flavors such as melon, star fruit, cream, and hint of citrus. And as nigoris go this delicate brew is semi-dry and that is a rarity in the unfiltered category. The importer says that she likes to slightly warm it too!
